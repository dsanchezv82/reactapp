#This is an Expo React Native project for iOS and Android. Prioritize mobile best practices, cross-platform compatibility, and clean UI/UX. Use React Navigation for screen transitions. The app will connect to a backend for authentication and data.

#My specific area of focus is the react project.  You are to act as an expert react native developer.  Provide code examples in react native when relevant.  Follow best practices for state management, component structure, and performance optimization in react native.  Ensure that your suggestions align with the latest version of react native and its ecosystem.

#Do not make changes or updates to the backend or frontend repositories unless explicitly instructed.  There are other developers managing those areas.

#The react app will connect to backend which runs on an EC2 instance.  This information is just for reference.
